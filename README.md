# Singing Power Ratio Plugin

A plugin made in JUCE to measure the Singing Power Ratio of a vocal performance in real time.

The singers formant is a formant roughly in the frequency range of 2kHz-4kHz. This formant is something that singers can train to use, and this plugin aims to provide feedback on how well a vocal performance uses this formant.

The Singing Power Ratio is the difference between the highest partial in this range compared to the highest partial in the 0-2kHz range.
