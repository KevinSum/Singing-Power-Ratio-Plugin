# Singing Power Ratio Plugin

A plugin made in JUCE to measure the Singing Power Ratio of a vocal performance in real time.

The singers formant is a formant roughly in the frequency range of 2kHz-4kHz. This formant is significant as it is a frequency range that isn't overly present in most instruments, allowing singers who utilize this formant to sing over loud instrumental accompaniments. As such, many singers aim to improve their use of this formant. This audio plugin aims to provide feedback on how well a vocal performance these frequencies.

The Singing Power Ratio is the difference between the highest partial in this range compared to the highest partial in the 0-2kHz range.
